		Hello there! If you need to contact me, please use the contact form on my <a
			rel="external"
			href="https://spimy.dev/contact"
			target="_blank">portfolio's contact page.</a
		>
		If it does not working then please reach out to me via my social media links which are in the footer
		on the same page.

		<br />
		<br />

		If you are trying to reach me to report a bug or to add new features to this web application,
		then please, instead of filling in the contact form in the aforementioned page, open a
		<a rel="external" href="https://github.com/Spimy/weather-app/issues" target="_blank"
