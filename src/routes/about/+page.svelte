	<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p>
		I created this because I was bored ðŸ˜´ but I didn't have time to start a new, larger project
		since at the time of creating this, I had a day left before I have a flight for vacation.
		<br />
		<br />
		At the same time, I wanted to give SvelteKit. Building a weather app is one of the many beginner
		projects so I thought, why not? That's how this page was created. Nothing fancy âœ¨.

	<h2>Attributions</h2>
	<p>
		This web application was made possible thanks to<a
			rel="external"
			href="https://openweathermap.org/"
			target="_blank">OpenWeather's</a
		>amazing API. Without it, there would be no real way to get access to weather data. If you are
		creating your own weather app, I recommend checking them out ðŸ˜ƒ.
